# CareConnect Journal
See our devpost entry for details about this project. Note that in this project, whiteboard and journal are synonymous.
## Page Tree
- / (index.html) - Although it's supposed to be the same as the whiteboards page, for this submission, it allows the user to switch between the proof-of-concept therapist and client view, as well as to access the rudimentary journal / whiteboard.
  - /whiteboard/ (index.html) - Shows whiteboards available for editing.
    - all whiteboards available on site. 
    - example.html - Demonstrates the whiteboard that we designed.
  - /doctor/ (index.html) - Shows how a doctor would see elements.

## Planned features.
### Doctors:
- Access summaries of whiteboards (access to full whiteboards is granted, but due to the busy nature of doctors, by default, changes to whiteboards will be prioritized instead)
- Problem ledgers: allows for doctors to organize concepts of concern for each client. Each whiteboard can have each contribution flagged, allowing for doctors to keep topics of concern organized
- Create and archive whiteboards

### Clients
- Access whiteboards (optional, only if this is used for more than one therapy type).
- Tabs in whiteboards: switch between public and private whiteboards.
  - Public ones allow for all family members to try finding solutions. The digital interface serves as a buffer to mitigate the confrontational manner of criticism.
  - Private ones allow for issues to be brought up by the therapist in the next session, to allow for peaceful solutions if a strong point of contention occurs.
- Timeline: Brief summary of issues and their resolution
  - Shows all the progress done in therapy.
